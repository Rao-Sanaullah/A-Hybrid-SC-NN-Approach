# A-Hybrid-SC-NN-Approach

In this article, we propose a novel standalone hybrid Spiking-Convolutional Neural Network (SC-NN) model for advancing Computer Vision. Our approach uses the unique capabilities of SNNs, such as event-based computation and temporal processing, along with the strong representation learning abilities of CNNs, to generate high-quality results. 

The hybrid approach aims to create a more comprehensive and biologically inspired model that can effectively handle complex inpainting tasks. Therefore, The fusion of SNN and CNN architectures enables the model to capture both the local and temporal aspects of visual data, potentially leading to improved performance and more efficient processing in tasks such as image inpainting.
