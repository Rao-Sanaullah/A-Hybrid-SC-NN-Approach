# A-Hybrid-SC-NN-Approach

In this article, we propose a novel standalone hybrid Spiking-Convolutional Neural Network (SC-NN) model for advancing Computer Vision.  
Our approach uses the unique capabilities of SNNs, such as event-based computation and temporal processing, along with the strong representation learning abilities of CNNs, to generate high-quality results.
